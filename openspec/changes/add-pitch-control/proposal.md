## Why

Karaoke singers often need songs in different keys to match their vocal range. Songs that are too high or too low can be uncomfortable or impossible to sing. Currently, users have no way to adjust the pitch, forcing them to either struggle with uncomfortable keys or skip songs entirely.

## What Changes

- Add pitch control UI with Â±3 semitone adjustment range
- Use HTML5 `preservesPitch` and `playbackRate` to shift pitch
- Provide pitch controls on both host and client views
- Display current pitch offset (+0, +1, -2, etc.)
- Sync pitch state across all clients via WebSocket
- Reset pitch to 0 when song changes

## Impact
